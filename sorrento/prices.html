          <p>So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time!</p>
        </li>
        <li id="test-2">
          <p>This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing!</p>
        </li>
        <li id="test-3">
          <p>Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!</p>
        </li>
        <li id="test-4">
          <p>Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt. Thank you.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="test-5">
          <p>What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely self-contained and very private. We loved it and will return again and again.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="test-6">
          <p>Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever!</p>
        </li>
        <li id="test-7">
          <p>A few minutes’ walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel over the shoulder - can't think of anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne!</p>
        </li>
        <li id="test-8">
          <p>Relaxing in that sunny garden watching our dog chasing balls. Let me stay forever!</p>
